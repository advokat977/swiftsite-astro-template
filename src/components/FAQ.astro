    q: "What exactly do I get within 72 hours?",
    a: "A clean, fast landing site with: professional contact form, SEO basics, and premium hosting on Cloudflare Pages. Plus/Pro plans add Calendar and/or Zoom integrations."
  },
  {
    q: "Is hosting included?",
    a: "Yes—your site is deployed to Cloudflare Pages as part of the setup. Domain registration and any third-party services are billed separately."
  },
  {
    q: "How do you handle spam without exposing an email address?",
    a: "Messages are submitted server-side (no public email) and protected with anti-spam (e.g., Cloudflare Turnstile)."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I upgrade later?",
    a: "Absolutely. You can move from Basic to Plus or Pro anytime—we enable the extras and redeploy."
  },
  {
    q: "What if my content isn’t ready?",
    a: "We can publish with tasteful placeholders and swap in your final copy and images later."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I get access to the code and versions?",
    a: "Yes. The project lives in a Git repo and deployments are triggered via a build hook. You can audit changes and roll back if needed."
  },
